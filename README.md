My journey in the tech world started with curiosity, and it has led me to explore various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. I believe in the power of code to solve real-world problems and enhance lives.

## Projects 🚀

Here are some of the projects I'm proud to have worked on:

### [UpScore](https://www.upscoretestprep.com/)

A learning management platform for students and schools. The UpScore Test Prep Program is made up of five subject areas:  English, Math, Science, Reading, and Writing.  The UpScore Website includes subject and topic-specific text lessons, videos, and quizzes, and five comprehensive ACT simulated tests.  The lesson quizzes and comprehensive assessments measure a student’s content knowledge of each ACT subject, predicted score, and provide diagnostic reports identifying subject-specific skill strengths and weaknesses and a custom content-specific study plan to improve student scores in the least amount of time. Lesson quizzes provide the student with ongoing diagnostic reporting assessing their understanding of the material they cover in each lesson while the comprehensive tests assess total knowledge of every subject, specific skill, and the student’s ability to correctly answer in the allotted time producing a predicted official ACT score. The Web-embedded diagnostic programming scores and reports practice quizzes, and comprehensive assessment provide test results in real time.  Diagnostic subject and overall reports are reported for individual students, classes, grades, multiple grades, groups, gender, age, ethnicity, English Learners, economically disadvantaged, disability, groups, school, programs, district and total program user,s and for UpScore Admin also include county, state, US, and globally.


### [University Living](https://www.universityliving.com)

University Living is a global student housing managed marketplace that assists students seeking higher education in finding housing near universities around the world. The goal of application is to make the transition into a student's life as easy as possible.
